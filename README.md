# CameraX Object Detection

This project demonstrates object detection using CameraX and TensorFlow Lite in a Jetpack Compose application.

## Features

- Camera preview using CameraX
- Object detection using TensorFlow Lite
- Real-time object detection and measurement

## Project Structure

- `datasource/`: Contains data source classes for loading TensorFlow Lite models.
- `ml/`: Contains machine learning related classes, including the object detection analyzer.
- `models/`: Contains data models used in the application.
- `repo/`: Contains repository classes for managing use cases.\
- `viewmodel/`: Contains ViewModel classes for managing UI-related data.
- `ui/`: Contains Jetpack Compose UI Components.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Android Studio
- Kotlin
- Gradle
- JDK 17

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/shaoyangdl/CameraXObjectDetection.git
    ```
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Sync the project with Gradle files.

### Running the App

1. Connect an Android device.
2. Click on the "Run" button in Android Studio.

## Usage

- The app will request camera permission on startup.
- Once granted, the camera preview will be displayed.
- Detected objects will be highlighted with bounding boxes.
- Reference Object will be highlighted with green color.
- Real-time measurement will be displayed on the bottom of the screen.

## Assumptions and Limitations

- The app assumes only two objects are detected, one is reference, the other is target object.
- The app assumes the reference object is a mouse with a size of 114mm x 74mm.
- The app assumes the target object is a coin with a diameter of 15mm.
- If the reference object is not detected, the app will not display the measurement.
- NNAPI is not supported due to already deprecated in Android 15. 
- Screen rotation is disabled due to limited time but adaptive layout by jetpack compose is possible.
- Limited test cases. I haven't found a good example of test cases for ML.
